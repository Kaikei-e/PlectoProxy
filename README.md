Plecto pairs **two complementary halves** through a typed [WIT](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/) contract:

- a **fast path** in native Rust — connection handling, TLS termination, HTTP/1.1·2·3, routing, load balancing, and upstream management;
- an **extension plane** of **WebAssembly Component Model filters** — the per-request *decisions* (auth, header/body rewriting, rate limiting, WAF, policy) that you write in **any language**, plug in over the `plecto:filter` contract, and **hot-swap with zero downtime**.

The speed-critical path stays native Rust. Your request logic runs as a sandboxed WASM component that can touch **only** the capabilities the host explicitly lends it — enforced by the sandbox, not by convention.

> [!WARNING]
> **Status: early development.** The design is settled (10 ADRs) and the first vertical slice — the `plecto:filter` contract, a wasmtime host that loads and runs filters, an example filter, and a full test suite — is green and on CI. **The data path (TLS/HTTP/routing/upstream) is not built yet; Plecto cannot proxy live traffic today.** This is a foundation you can read, run the tests on, and build filters against. See the [Roadmap](#roadmap).

## Why Plecto?

Every gateway eventually faces the same question: **where does custom logic go?** The classic answers each involve trade-offs:

| Approach | In-process speed | Sandboxed | Any language | Hot-swap |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Config / DSL | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Recompile into the binary | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Out-of-process (`ext_proc`, sidecar) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **WASM filters — Plecto** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

Running data-plane filters as WASM is an idea **Envoy and proxy-wasm pioneered and proved** over the better part of a decade — Plecto owes them the core insight. proxy-wasm targets the earlier WASM ABI (v0.2.1); since then the **Component Model and WIT** have matured into a typed, polyglot, composable foundation, and Plecto explores what a gateway looks like when it is built natively on them. High-performance Rust proxies such as **Cloudflare's Pingora** likewise show how fast a native data path can be. Plecto's particular focus is **pairing that native speed with a Component-Model extension plane** — for teams who want to self-host and keep their traffic and secrets on their own infrastructure, with **data sovereignty** as a first principle.

See [ADR 000001](docs/ADR/000001.md) for the full rationale and rejected alternatives.

## Design tenets

> Safety × portability × self-hostability × operational simplicity **＞** feature breadth × broad privilege × distributed-by-default.

- **Deny-by-default capabilities** — a filter can reach nothing but the host-API explicitly lent to it (KV, counter, metrics, log, clock, random). No outbound network, filesystem, or sockets unless granted. Enforced by the Component Model sandbox.
- **Decisions are typed** — a filter returns a `decision` variant: `continue` / `modified` / `short-circuit`. Never an ambiguous flag or an implicit side effect.
- **Init vs per-request** — expensive setup (regex compile, schema build) goes in an `init` hook; the per-request hot path stays lean.
- **Filters are stateless** — rate-limit, session, and cache state live in host KV, so filters pool, scale, and hot-swap cleanly.
- **Fail-closed** — a filter trap or deadline overrun never silently passes traffic through.
- **Single-node first** — one node completes the job; distribution (membership, config consensus) is opt-in.
- **No panics in the data plane** — a single bad request must never take down a worker.

## Architecture

```
            ┌────────────────────────── fast path (native Rust) ──────────────────────────┐
client ───▶ │ accept · TLS · HTTP/1.1·2·3 · routing · LB · upstream conn mgmt · hot-reload │ ───▶ upstream
            └───────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────┘
                            │  request chain                    response chain │
                            ▼  (WIT: plecto:filter)             (reverse)       ▲
            ┌──────────── extension plane (WASM Component Model filters) ───────────────┐
            │  per filter: init hook (heavy, once) + per-request hook (hot)             │
            │  returns a decision: continue | modified | short-circuit                  │
            │  touches ONLY the host-API the host lent it (deny-by-default capability)   │
            └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                         │ host-API (KV / counter / metrics / log / clock / random)
                                         ▼
                              host-held state: redb (KV / rate-limit / cache)
```

**Rule of thumb:** user-specific logic / policy / WAF / auth / rewrite → a WASM filter; TLS / routing / LB / connection pools / global counters → native Rust. The WASM "tax" (data copy + host-call overhead) is charged only to request-decision logic, never to the speed path.

## The filter contract

The heart of Plecto is the `plecto:filter` WIT world — a custom world that defines Plecto's own vocabulary (the typed `decision`, init/per-request hooks, the deny-by-default host-API) while reusing standard types for polyglot compatibility.

```wit
package plecto:filter@0.1.0;

interface types {
  // The typed outcome of a request-side filter. Never a bare flag.
  variant request-decision {
    %continue,                       // pass unchanged to the next filter
    modified(request-edit),          // apply the edit, then continue
    short-circuit(http-response),    // stop the chain; synthesise a response now
  }
}

// deny-by-default: one capability per interface; a filter imports only what it is lent.
interface host-kv  { get: func(key: string) -> option<list<u8>>; set: func(key: string, value: list<u8>); /* … */ }
interface host-log { log: func(level: level, message: string); }

world filter {
  import host-log;   import host-clock;   import host-kv;   // granted capabilities only
  export init: func();                                       // heavy, once per instance
  export on-request:  func(req: http-request)  -> request-decision;   // hot path
  export on-response: func(resp: http-response) -> response-decision;  // hot path
}
```

> v0.1.0 is intentionally **sync + header-only** on the stable wasmtime 45 toolchain. `stream<u8>` bodies, async hooks, and `wasi:http` type reuse arrive with wasmtime 46 — see [ADR 000003](docs/ADR/000003.md) / [ADR 000010](docs/ADR/000010.md).

## Writing a filter

A filter is just a component that implements the world. Here is the included example (`crates/filter-hello`), in Rust:

```rust
wit_bindgen::generate!({ path: "../../wit", world: "filter" });

struct FilterHello;

impl Guest for FilterHello {
    fn init() {}

    fn on_request(req: HttpRequest) -> RequestDecision {
        host_log::log(host_log::Level::Info, "filter-hello: on-request");
        if req.headers.iter().any(|h| h.name.eq_ignore_ascii_case("x-plecto-block")) {
            RequestDecision::ShortCircuit(HttpResponse { status: 403, /* … */ })
        } else {
            RequestDecision::Continue
        }
    }

    fn on_response(_: HttpResponse) -> ResponseDecision { ResponseDecision::Continue }
}

export!(FilterHello);
```

Because the contract is WIT, **any language that compiles to a WASM component can write a filter** — Rust, Go (TinyGo), JavaScript/TypeScript (`jco`), or Python (`componentize-py`). Polyglot filter SDKs are on the [roadmap](#roadmap).

## Try it

```bash
# Prerequisites: Rust 1.96+ (edition 2024) and the wasm32-unknown-unknown target.
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Build and test everything. The host build script compiles the example filter to a
# WASM component and the tests load it into the wasmtime host and exercise the contract.
cd plecto
cargo test --all
```

The suite proves the slice end-to-end: a request flows through the host into a real filter component, the typed `decision` round-trips, and the filter reaches **only** the capabilities it was lent (the example component imports `plecto:filter/*` and nothing else — zero WASI, network, or filesystem access).

## Roadmap

Plecto is built ADR-first; each milestone realizes specific design decisions in `docs/ADR/`.

- **M0 — Foundation** ✅ *(done)*
  The `plecto:filter@0.1.0` contract, a wasmtime host that loads & runs filters, a deny-by-default capability boundary (log / clock / kv), an example filter, E2E/conformance/unit tests, and CI. — [ADR 1](docs/ADR/000001.md) · [2](docs/ADR/000002.md) · [10](docs/ADR/000010.md)
- **M1 — Filter runtime hardening**
  `InstancePre` + pooling-allocator instance reuse, epoch metering + memory limits, pooling zeroization, redb-backed host KV / counters. The trusted = pooled-init-once / untrusted = per-request-zeroize split is *forced* (not just perf) by the init/zeroization knot. — [ADR 4](docs/ADR/000004.md) · [6](docs/ADR/000006.md) · [11](docs/ADR/000011.md)
- **M2 — The data path (fast path)**
  TCP/TLS listener, HTTP/1.1 → 2 → 3, routing, real filter-chain dispatch, upstream connection management & load balancing. *This is what turns Plecto into an actual proxy.*
- **M3 — Async & bodies** *(two-stage trigger)*
  **Stage 1 — host can run P3:** upgrade to wasmtime 46 (Component Model async + WASI 0.3 on by default). **Stage 2 — P3 guests are practical to write:** `wasm32-wasip3` reaching Tier 2 / wit-bindgen async maturing. The body work (async-first contract, `stream<u8>` bodies, `wasi:http` type reuse, body-transform filters) is tied to **Stage 2** — starting it the moment wasmtime 46 lands risks stalling on guest tooling. Body-untouching is expressed at the **type level** (separate header/body exports) so zero-copy bypass follows from the contract; stream splicing itself lands later with WASI 0.3.x. — [ADR 3](docs/ADR/000003.md) · [5](docs/ADR/000005.md) · [10](docs/ADR/000010.md)
- **M4 — Provenance & zero-downtime reload**
  OCI-artifact filter distribution + cosign signature verification, content-hash-reconciled hot reload from a declarative manifest. — [ADR 6](docs/ADR/000006.md) · [8](docs/ADR/000008.md)
- **M5 — Observability & opt-in distribution**
  `wasi-otel` tracing with host-propagated span context; opt-in `foca`/`openraft` config consensus. — [ADR 7](docs/ADR/000007.md) · [9](docs/ADR/000009.md)
- **M6 — Polyglot SDKs & reference filters**
  Go / JS / Python filter templates and reference auth / rate-limit / WAF filters.

## Design decisions

Plecto records every load-bearing decision as an ADR, in the Fork form (*decision / rationale / re-examination condition*):

| # | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| [001](docs/ADR/000001.md) | Adopt the WASM Component Model / WIT; structure Plecto as two complementary halves |
| [002](docs/ADR/000002.md) | Define a custom `plecto:filter` world that reuses `wasi:http` types |
| [003](docs/ADR/000003.md) | Async-first contract: `stream<u8>` bodies, `wasm32-wasip2` → P3 |
| [004](docs/ADR/000004.md) | Pooled, stateless filters; state lives in host KV (redb) |
| [005](docs/ADR/000005.md) | Split header-only vs body-transform; keep the hot path native |
| [006](docs/ADR/000006.md) | Security: deny-by-default capabilities, epoch metering, OCI signing, pooling zeroization |
| [007](docs/ADR/000007.md) | Observability via `wasi-otel`; host-managed trace span propagation |
| [008](docs/ADR/000008.md) | OCI-artifact distribution; content-hash-reconciled zero-downtime reload |
| [009](docs/ADR/000009.md) | Single-node first; distribution opt-in; static declarative config + hot reload |
| [010](docs/ADR/000010.md) | First increment: sync + own http types on `wasm32-unknown-unknown`; defer async to wasmtime 46 |
| [011](docs/ADR/000011.md) | "Stateless" = no carried-over mutable state; the trusted/untrusted instance split is forced by the init/zeroization knot |
