//! plecto-control — the control plane (ADR 000007 / 000008).
//!
//! A single declarative TOML manifest pins filters by OCI digest and declares one chain. An
//! `ArtifactStore` resolves each filter from a local, offline OCI image-layout (remote
//! registry fetch via `wkg` is an out-of-band operator step, kept out of the runtime), the
//! `Host` loads it through the ADR 000006 provenance gate, and a chain dispatcher drives a
//! request through the loaded filters. `reload` rebuilds the set and swaps it **atomically**
//! (ArcSwap): new requests see the new set, in-flight holders keep the old one until it
//! drops. Single-node-first (ADR 000008).
//!
//! The trust policy lives on the `Host` and is fixed at construction; changing trust roots
//! requires a new `Control`. `reload` swaps only the filter set + chain (same `Host`, same
//! epoch ticker), so a runaway filter stays bounded across reloads.

// Hot-path discipline (bp-rust): no unwrap/expect/panic/indexing on the data plane. Exempted
// under `cfg(test)` — this crate's own `#[cfg(test)] mod` blocks legitimately use them;
// `tests/*.rs` integration tests are separate crates and are never subject to this attribute.
// plecto-control is config/build-time (not per-request), but its Maglev/weighted-split hashing
// and route matching are still touched by the fast path indirectly, so the same discipline
// applies (added at Stage 3, after the `hash.rs`/`maglev.rs`/`weighted.rs` fixes it surfaces).
//
// `clippy::pedantic`/`clippy::nursery` are NOT enabled here (nor in plecto-host/plecto-server):
// a dry run measures 400+ pre-existing hits crate-wide, almost entirely pre-existing stylistic
// noise unrelated to this refactor's scope; scoped-allow-ing all of them would be disproportionate
// busy-work. Left as a known, explicit gap rather than silently skipped.
