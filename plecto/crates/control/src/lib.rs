//! plecto-control — the control plane (ADR 000007 / 000008).
//!
//! A single declarative TOML manifest pins filters by OCI digest and declares one chain. An
//! `ArtifactStore` resolves each filter from a local, offline OCI image-layout (remote
//! registry fetch via `wkg` is an out-of-band operator step, kept out of the runtime), the
//! `Host` loads it through the ADR 000006 provenance gate, and a chain dispatcher drives a
//! request through the loaded filters. `reload` rebuilds the set and swaps it **atomically**
//! (ArcSwap): new requests see the new set, in-flight holders keep the old one until it
//! drops. Single-node-first (ADR 000008).
//!
//! The trust policy lives on the `Host` and is fixed at construction; changing trust roots
//! requires a new `Control`. `reload` swaps only the filter set + chain (same `Host`, same
//! epoch ticker), so a runaway filter stays bounded across reloads.
