//! `ConfigSnapshot` — a pinned view of one `ActiveConfig` for the span of a single request
//! transaction (f000004 #2). `Control::on_request` and `on_response` each load the active
//! config independently, so a reload landing *between* a request's two halves would run the
//! request side against config A and the response side against config B — only the in-flight
//! request at the reload instant, but asymmetric filtering nonetheless.
//!
//! A snapshot closes that: the fast-path server takes one snapshot per request and drives both
//! halves through it. The snapshot holds its `Arc<ActiveConfig>` until dropped, so a concurrent
//! reload swaps the *live* set without disturbing any transaction already in flight. Taking one
//! is cheap — a single atomic `Arc` clone.
