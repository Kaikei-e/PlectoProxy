//! Upstream instances, active-health-check state, and round-robin load balancing (ADR 000017).
//!
//! A manifest [`Upstream`] becomes a [`UpstreamGroup`] of [`UpstreamInstance`]s. Each instance
//! owns a single health state machine fed by BOTH sources: the background active-health prober
//! (the fast-path server runs it) and passive signals from real forwarded requests (a connect
//! failure demotes). The fast path picks a healthy instance per request by round-robin; when none
//! are healthy the upstream is fail-closed (the server responds 503).
//!
//! **The registry lives on `Control`, OUTSIDE the atomically-swapped `ActiveConfig`**, so health
//! state SURVIVES a reload (ADR 000017). [`UpstreamRegistry::reconcile`] diffs the manifest's
//! upstreams against the running set by `(name, address)`: an unchanged instance keeps its health,
//! a new address starts pessimistic (unhealthy), a removed one is dropped. Routing's
//! `CompiledRoute` holds an `Arc<UpstreamGroup>` rebuilt to point at the reconciled group on every
//! reload, so the per-request hot path never touches the registry lock.
