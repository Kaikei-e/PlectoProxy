//! Weighted traffic split / canary (ADR 000034): a route forwards not to one upstream but to a
//! weighted set of backends, in proportion to integer weights (`weight / Σweights`, Gateway-API
//! semantics). This sits ONE layer above the per-instance load balancer: it picks which
//! [`UpstreamGroup`] a request goes to; the chosen group then picks a healthy instance with its
//! own round-robin (ADR 000017 / 000024) and applies its own retry / circuit-breaker / health.
//!
//! ## Selection algorithm — error-diffusion / Webster apportionment (maximum-deficit rule)
//!
//! We want the weighted sequence to be EVENLY INTERLEAVED (a 5/95 split should emit the minority
//! every ~20th request, not 5 in a row), deterministically. The classical technique for this is
//! *apportionment*: at each step credit every backend its weight as a running "deficit" (how far
//! below its fair share it is) and serve the one with the LARGEST deficit, then debit the total
//! weight from it. This is the Webster / Sainte-Laguë highest-averages method (the unique *unbiased*
//! divisor method — Balinski & Young, *Fair Representation*, 1982); for a single ratio it is exactly
//! integer error diffusion (Bresenham, 1965); and the resulting sequence minimises the worst-case
//! deviation from the ideal proportion (Tijdeman's chairman-assignment problem, 1980), staying
//! within `< 1` of every backend's ideal cumulative count at all times. (Proxy folklore calls the
//! same rule "smooth weighted round-robin"; we implement the cited apportionment technique, not any
//! one proxy's code.)
//!
//! ## Plecto's adaptation — precompute once, pick lock-free
//!
//! The naive rule needs a per-pick read-modify-write of shared deficits, which would put a lock on
//! the hot path — at odds with the lock-free tenet ADR 000024 went to lengths to preserve. Because
//! the rule is PERIODIC with period `L = Σ(gcd-reduced weights)` (after `L` picks each backend has
//! been served exactly its reduced weight and the deficits return to zero), one period IS the entire
//! infinite schedule. So we run the apportionment ONCE at build into a `table` of backend indices
//! and let a request just advance a single atomic cursor: `table[cursor.fetch_add(1) % L]`.
//!
//! A backend whose group has no eligible instance is **skipped forward** in the table to the next
//! eligible one (renormalize over healthy), exactly as `UpstreamGroup::pick_inner` skips an
//! unhealthy instance. When NO backend is eligible the pick is `None` and the fast path fails
//! closed 503 — the same no-healthy fault as a single upstream (ADR 000017 / 000024).
