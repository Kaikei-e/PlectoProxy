//! plecto-server — the M2 fast path (ADR 000013, TLS 000014, HTTP/2 000015, HTTP/3 000016).
//!
//! A tokio listener that turns Plecto from a library into an actual reverse proxy. It serves
//! HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 over TCP (hyper, ALPN-negotiated — ADR 000015) and HTTP/3 over QUIC (quinn +
//! the h3 crate, an independent UDP listener advertised via `Alt-Svc` — ADR 000016). All three
//! transports feed the same transaction core (`proxy_core`); only the body adapters differ.
//! Per request it: builds a header-only `HttpRequest`, asks the control plane which route
//! matches (host + path prefix), runs that route's filter chain, and either responds now (a
//! filter short-circuited / failed closed) or forwards the request to the route's upstream and
//! runs the response side of the chain on the way back.
//!
//! **sync↔async bridge (the §6.3 prerequisite).** Filter execution is synchronous and runs on a
//! wasmtime `Store` that is `!Send`, so it cannot cross an `.await`. Each chain dispatch is moved
//! to tokio's blocking pool via `spawn_blocking`; the M1 trusted instance pool handles instance
//! reuse and saturation there. Route matching is pure config lookup and stays on the async thread.
//!
//! **Bodies are opaque (header-only contract, ADR 000010 / §6.7).** Filters never see the body;
//! the request body streams straight to the upstream and the response body streams straight back.
//! The chain only edits headers / status (and may synthesise a short-circuit body of its own).
