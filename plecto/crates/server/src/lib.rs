//! plecto-server — the M2 fast path (ADR 000013, TLS 000014, HTTP/2 000015, HTTP/3 000016).
//!
//! A tokio listener that turns Plecto from a library into an actual reverse proxy. It serves
//! HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 over TCP (hyper, ALPN-negotiated — ADR 000015) and HTTP/3 over QUIC (quinn +
//! the h3 crate, an independent UDP listener advertised via `Alt-Svc` — ADR 000016). All three
//! transports feed the same transaction core (`proxy_core`); only the body adapters differ.
//! Per request it: builds a header-only `HttpRequest`, asks the control plane which route
//! matches (host + path prefix), runs that route's filter chain, and either responds now (a
//! filter short-circuited / failed closed) or forwards the request to the route's upstream and
//! runs the response side of the chain on the way back.
//!
//! **sync↔async bridge (the §6.3 prerequisite).** Filter execution is synchronous and runs on a
//! wasmtime `Store` that is `!Send`, so it cannot cross an `.await`. Each chain dispatch is moved
//! to tokio's blocking pool via `spawn_blocking`; the M1 trusted instance pool handles instance
//! reuse and saturation there. Route matching is pure config lookup and stays on the async thread.
//!
//! **Request body: buffered ONLY when a filter reads it (ADR 000025 / 000038).** A route whose
//! filters all target the header-only `filter` world streams the request body straight to the
//! upstream (zero-copy); a route with a filter that exports `on-request-body` (`reads_body`) has the
//! body buffered (bounded) and run through the `on-request-body` chain. The response body always
//! streams straight back — filters see response headers / status only (they may synthesise a
//! short-circuit body of their own).

/// glibc defaults to `8 × ncpu` arenas on 64-bit. Under a many-threaded proxy doing bursty
/// per-request allocations, freed memory lingers in each thread's arena instead of returning to the
/// OS, inflating RSS (measured ~2.5× at 1 MB bodies × 50 conns — docs/servey body-tax). This is a
